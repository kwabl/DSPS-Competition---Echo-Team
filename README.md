# DSPS-Competition---Echo-Team
The third DSPS student competition sought to apply AI for pavement condition monitoring. This involved using machine learning algorithms to predict road sections' pavement condition index (PCI) based on images captured from infrastructure-mounted sensors. Training datasets consist of Top-down views of pavement image data and corresponding pavement condition indices. Resnet50 and Densesnet161 pre-trained models were proposed for this competition. Different data augmentation techniques were also experimented to determine how they affected the models. The proposed models were finally ‘ensembled’ to find the best model for the PCI predictions. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute percentage Error (MAPE) were selected to evaluate the model accuracy in this PCI prediction task.
